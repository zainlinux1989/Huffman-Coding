# Huffman-Coding

Huffman compression and decompression using C++, project contain .cpp, .h, <br>sample data files on which compression and decompression perform
file contain in the form of <b>'0'</b> and <b>'1'</b> form.<br><br>

<b>Issue:</b> function of delete nodes not call due to some error, .cpp file contain delete node function but not called in program.

<ul>
  <li> <b>.8b</b> are original data files.
  <li> <b>.zif</b> are compressed files.
  <li> <b>_N.8b</b> are decompressed file.
</ul>
